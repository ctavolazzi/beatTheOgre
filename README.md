"It's a simple game, sir, but it checks out."

UPDATE
v0.2 

In this simple text-based RPG, choose to fight either a Bug, a Fox, or a Man as you grind to become strong enough to Beat the Ogre, Malgroth.

There are three displays:

1) The Game Log, which displays the current events of the game.
2) The Combat Log, which displays the events currently taking place in combat.
3) The Player Stats, which displays the current stats of the player (you).

You can fight as many enemies at once as you like, but the displays get really weird if you do that.

Try to stick to fighting only one enemy at a time.

The buttons above the displays allow you to choose which enemy you wish to fight.

I recommend starting with the Bug, and working your way up from there.



CODE:

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO EXPERIMENT WITH THE CODE TO CREATE MORE ENEMIES, ITEMS, OR TO PLAY WITH THE STAT BALANCES.

I have been learning how to write JavaScript since the beginning of the pandemic. 

I have been gradually learning more and more. This game may not be terribly impressive on its own, but it was a hell of a lot of fun learning how to make it work.

It uses a blend of object-oriented and functional programming techniques.

When the user clicks one of the buttons, a new enemy of the chosen type is constructed.

Some of the enemies properties (name, inventory) are randomly populated.

Then the Player is pitted against the new enemy. They strike each other until one of them dies.

XP is then awarded, level ups may occur, and items may be dropped and picked up. 



FUTURE PLANS:

I intend to return to this project as I pick up more techniques and technologies in the Hack Reactor bootcamp. I expect to graduate April, 2021.


Thanks, enjoy! If you end up making something using this please send it to me! I'd love to see it.
